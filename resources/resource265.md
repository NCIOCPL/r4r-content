NCICT is an easy-to-use computed tomography (CT) organ dose calculator used to assess and monitor radiation exposures from CT scans. This user-friendly software gives rigorously validated results using state-of-the-art computational human phantoms and simulation of x-rays from a reference CT scanner. This tool is part of NCIDose, a collection of medical radiation dosimetry tools developed by radiation physicists from the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch.

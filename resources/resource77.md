Statistical software designed to generate multiple summary measures to evaluate and monitor health disparities. HD*Calc allows the user to import Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) or other population-based health data and calculate any of eleven disparity measurements. Cancer rates and other data categorized by disparity groups such as race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic area can be used with HD*Calc to generate output presented in tabular and graphic formats.

NCIRF provides accurate x-ray dosimetry for patients undergoing radiography or interventional fluoroscopy. This user-friendly software gives rigorously validated results using state-of-the-art computational human phantoms and on-the-fly Monte Carlo calculations. This tool is part of NCIDose, a collection of medical radiation dosimetry tools developed by radiation physicists from the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch.

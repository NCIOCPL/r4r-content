Tobacco use should be addressed in every clinical setting where cancer is treated. This is especially important in the oncology setting because smoking cessation protects against cancer and benefits both individuals going through cancer treatment and those who have completed treatment. Health care professionals, particularly those in oncology care, should treat tobacco use and dependence. Indeed, cessation treatment has been deemed a “pillar” of cancer care.

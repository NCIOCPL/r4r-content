The DIGGIT package integrates patient-matched genomic mutation and gene expression data with corresponding gene regulatory networks to identify candidate driver mutations that are upstream of and directly perturb master regulators. Master regulators are transcription factors that control the majority of genes differentially expressed between two molecular phenotypes.

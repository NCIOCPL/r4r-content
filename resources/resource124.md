CGAP was pursued to determine the gene expression profiles of normal, precancer, and cancer cells, leading eventually to improved detection, diagnosis, and treatment for patients. CGAP also provides single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of cancer-related genes and the Mitleman database of chromosomal aberrations in cancer. Resources generated by the CGAP initiative are available to the broad cancer community. Interconnected modules provide access to all CGAP data, bioinformatic analysis tools, and biological resources, allowing the user to find "in silico" answers to biological questions in a fraction of the time it once took in the laboratory.

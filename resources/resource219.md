HINTS routinely collects nationally representative data about the American public's knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of cancer- and health-related information. The survey provides updates on changing patterns, needs, and information opportunities in health; identifies changing communications trends and practices; assesses cancer information access and usage; provides information about how cancer risks are perceived; and offers a testbed to researchers to test new theories in health communication.

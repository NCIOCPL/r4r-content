The Know Your Chances websites provides interactive risk charts to put cancer in context. The risk charts show the likelihood of dying from a variety of cancer types and other diseases over a specific time frame. Because age, sex, and race are so important in determining a person's chances of dying from cancer or another disease, the charts allow the user to account for those factors.

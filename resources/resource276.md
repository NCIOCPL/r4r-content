The data science training hub functions as a one-stop shop for trainees and cancer researchers looking to enhance their knowledge and understanding of data science in cancer research. Through this hub, trainees and researchers have access to tools and resources to learn about NCI data science initiatives, the value of data science, and the basics of the six stages of the data science lifecycle (data generation and collection, data cleaning, data exploration and analysis, predictive modeling, data visualization, and data sharing). The Training Guide Library offers in-depth beginner and advanced guides and videos for each section of the data science lifecycle. In addition, trainees and researchers have access to an on-demand Cancer Data Science Course, a curated educational course that explains the basic skills needed to thrive in cancer data science.

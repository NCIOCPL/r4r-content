Published monthly and managed by NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS), the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) provides a responsive, clinical science-based ontology used in NCI semantic infrastructure and information systems. It covers terminology for clinical care, translational and basic research, and public information and administrative activities. NCIt is also a widely recognized standard for biomedical coding and reference, used by a broad variety of public and private partners both nationally and internationally.

NCIt provides definitions, synonyms, and other information, which are maintained and organized in a richly structured description logic environment, by a multidisciplinary team of editors.

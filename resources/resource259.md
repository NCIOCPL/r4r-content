The Youth Compendium of Physical Activities, available in English, Spanish and Mandarin Chinese, provides a list of 196 common activities in which youth participate and the estimated energy cost associated with each activity. It is intended for widespread use by researchers, state and local health departments, educators, fitness professionals, and in the commercial sector for development of metrics related to exercise equipment and behavioral interventions. The tool can be used to: • Summarize energy expenditures from diverse activities reported in physical activity questionnaires • Contribute to the design of physical activity interventions via the selection of physiologically comparable programmatic elements • Help in the design of fitness programs • Aid in the comparison and evaluation of school- and community-based programs and activities.


The Youth Compendium was developed by the National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research (NCCOR), a partnership of the four leading funders of childhood obesity research: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

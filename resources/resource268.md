For *de novo* mutational signature analysis, estimating the correct number of signatures is the crucial starting point since it influences all the downstream steps, including extraction of signature profiles, estimation of signature activities, and classification of tumors based on the estimated activities. SUITOR is an unsupervised cross-validation R package to select the optimal number of signatures for mutational signature analysis. SUITOR was developed by researchers in the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Biostatistics Branch.

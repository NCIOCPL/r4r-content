Phantoms is a library of state-of-the-art, whole-body computational phantoms representing children and adults of different body height and weight. Computational phantoms are three-dimensional computerized representations of the human body which are used to study exposure to medical, occupational, and environmental radiation. Each phantom contains more than 100 carefully delineated organs or tissues. This tool is part of NCIDose, a collection of medical radiation dosimetry tools developed by radiation physicists from the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch.

AccrualNet provides access to vetted literature, resources, and tools to inform and support a physicianâ€™s practice, join clinical trials professionals in dialogue focused on improved accrual, and participate in a virtual community of practice.

The AccrualNet team selects journal articles and other resources for inclusion on the site based on two primary factors: Is it relevant to clinical trial professionals and is it useful to supporting accrual efforts? The journal articles are selected mostly from peer-reviewed journals, but occasionally the team will select something from a less scholarly source, if the information is valuable to the AccrualNet community.

AccrualNet also contains non-journal content ranging from templates, sample materials created by others, slide sets for training presentations, checklists, and more.

The CCDI CCDC is an inventory of childhood cancer data resources.  The inventory includes a summary description, data content types, and links to access the data summary information on each resource page. The data catalog is intended to help researchers learn about existing pediatric data resources to develop new biomedical hypothesis or analyze the data for clinical or therapeutic efficacy.

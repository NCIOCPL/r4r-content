ITCR is a trans-NCI program providing support for informatics resources across the development lifecycle, including the development of innovative methods and algorithms, early stage software development advanced stage software development, and sustainment of high-value resources on which the community has come to depend. Examples of relevant topics include but are not limited to:  experiment design and execution, data collection, data processing and analysis,  data quality assessment, data integration, data presentation and visualization, text mining and natural language processing, data compression, storage, organization, transmission.

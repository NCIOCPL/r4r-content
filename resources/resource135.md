This software converts ASCII text data files to the SEER*Stat database format, allowing users to analyze cancer data (incidence, mortality, expected survival) using SEER*Stat. SEER*Prep performs two main functions: it converts text data to the specific binary format required by SEER*Stat, and it creates the SEER*Stat data dictionary. SEER*Stat 6.2.3 or later is required to analyze any database generated with this version of SEER*Prep.

title: ACT24 - Physical Activities Completed over Time in 24 Hoursate
description: >
  Activities Completed over Time in 24-hours (ACT24) is a free web-based recall instrument for epidemiologic, interventional, behavioral, or clinical research. ACT24 estimates daily summary values for physical activity and sedentary behavior, including energy expenditure, time spent sitting and in different types and intensities of physical activity based on previous-day reporting from participant.

Activities Completed over Time in 24-hours (ACT24) is a free web-based recall instrument that was designed to estimate daily summary values for physical activity and sedentary behavior, including energy expenditure, time spent sitting and in different types and intensities of physical activity. ACT24 has been examined for validity in middle-aged and older adults and has been used to provide detailed portraits of human time-use and energy expenditure at the population level.

ACT24 is freely available for use by researchers, teachers, clinicians, and others interested in assessing daily physical activity levels.  The ACT24 system has two distinct websites, a Researcher Site for researchers and a Participant Site for study participants.

The Researcher Site is used by study teams to register their projects, generate participant log-in keys, and download data entered by participants.  Study participants use researcher-provided log-in keys to access the Participant Site and enter their data.

The recall data provided by participants is processed in real-time and made available for download on the Researcher Site. An Application Programming Interface (API) is available to link ACT24 recall data to study management systems to facilitate automated data collection.

Dose Conversion Coefficients provides calculated photon and neutron radiation dose coefficients for organs and tissues of pediatric phantoms. This tool is part of NCIDose, a collection of medical radiation dosimetry tools developed by radiation physicists from the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch.

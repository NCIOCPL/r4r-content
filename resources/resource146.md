Modulator Inference by Network Dynamics (MINDy2)/ Conditional Inference of Network Dynamics (CINDy). MINDy2 and CINDy both infer modulatory events in the cell. They do this by screening a list of candidate modulator proteins and assessing their effect on the transcriptional control of a transcription factor of interest. CINDy uses a more sophisticated algorithm: while both try to assess the effects of a modulator over a transcriptional network, CINDy uses the entire expression range of the modulator.

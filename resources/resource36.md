Consortium of NCI-sponsored investigators who use statistical/simulation modeling to examine the impact of prevention, screening, and treatment on cancer incidence and mortality. These models can then project future trends and help determine optimal cancer control strategies. These models can also be used to guide public health research and priorities. Established in 2000, CISNET comprises six cancer site groups:  breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, esophageal, and cervical.

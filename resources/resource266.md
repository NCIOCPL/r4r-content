NCINM provides accurate dosimetry for patients undergoing nuclear medicine procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This user-friendly software gives rigorously validated results using state-of-the-art computational human phantoms and a comprehensive library of dose conversion coefficients for various radionuclides. This tool is part of NCIDose, a collection of medical radiation dosimetry tools developed by radiation physicists from the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch.

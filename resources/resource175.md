The CPTAC Data Portal represents NCIâ€™s largest public repository of proteogenomic comprehensive sequence datasets. All data is publicly accessible and available for download upon data use agreement. File types available for download include analyses of CPTAC raw mass spectrometry-based data files, such as mapping of spectra to peptide sequences and protein identification by individual CPTAC investigators and by a Common Data Analysis Pipeline. Proteomic data and related data files are organized into datasets by study, sub-proteome, and analysis site.

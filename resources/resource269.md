TCRAT is an R package which implements a risk prediction model developed by NCI researchers to calculate the absolute risk of developing a second primary thyroid cancer in individuals who were diagnosed with a cancer during their childhood. TCRAT was developed by researchers in the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Biostatistics Branch.
